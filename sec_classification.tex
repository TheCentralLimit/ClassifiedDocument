The GW observatory, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), can provide very rapid mass estimates of candidate GW events. Since most of these detections are mostly binary black holes and electromagnetic followup is extremely expensive, only a few events can be followed up. We have therefore trained a classifier to determine if an event will have a electromagnetic followup. We trained this classifier on the first half of the data. We simply took the mid-way point betweewn the maximum chirp mass for the electromagnetic counterpart group and the other group. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:half}. This was then used on the whole dataset as shown in Figure \ref{fig:all}.
