We created a classifier to distinguish between GW events with and without electromagnetic counterparts. This classifier was trained using half of the data. The classifier correctly classified both groups completely without any contamination for both the training set and the full dataset. Figure \ref{fig:chirp} and \ref{fig:2D} shows the correlation between 1D and 2D mass distributions and the classification of the two groups.
