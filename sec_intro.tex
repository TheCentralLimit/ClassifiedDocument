The detection of gravitational waves (GW) on September 14, 2015, opened a new into the Universe. Joint observations of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to the GW signals will result in a deeper understanding of the physics involved. We anticipate EM counterparts to binary sources involving matter i.e. neutron star-neutron star (NSNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries. In an effort to measure these joint signals, GW detectors are working in conjunction with traditional observatories. Some of these will yield weak, nearly isotropic electromagnetic counterparts and others will not.

This report is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:dist} describes the developement of the chirp mass distribution, Section \ref{sec:classifier} descibes a EM followup classifier based on the data, and Section 4 will state our conclusions.
