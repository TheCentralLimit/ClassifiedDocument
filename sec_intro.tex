\initial{T} {\bf he detection of gravitational waves (GW) on September 14, 2015 \parencite{2016PhRvL.116f1102A}, opened a new window into the Universe. Joint observations of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to the GW signals will result in a deeper understanding of the physics involved. We anticipate EM counterparts to binary sources involving matter, i.e. neutron star--neutron star and neutron star--black hole binaries. In an effort to measure these joint signals, GW detectors are working in conjunction with traditional observatories.}

{\bf This report is organized as follows. In \S\ref{sec:dist}, we describe the estimation of the chirp mass distribution. In \S\ref{sec:classifier} we descibe an EM followup classifier based on the data.
