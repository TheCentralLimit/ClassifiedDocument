\subsection{Density Estimation}

We use a histogram to estimate the merger rate as a function of $\mathcal{M}_c$. Since we are interested in the intrinsic rate, not just those that we detect, we weigh each point by the inverse of the spacetime volume in which we are sensitive to it, $w = 1 / VT$. Binaries with a higher chirp mass are easier detect, so we do not want to count them as heavily. For a given chirp mass, we are sensitive out to a distance of

\begin{equation}
  D =
  \SI{200}{\mega\parsec} \qty( \mathcal{M}_c / \SI{1.2}{\Msun} )^{5/6}
\end{equation}
