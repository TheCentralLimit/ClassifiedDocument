\subsection{Model fitting}
\label{subsec:fitting}
We employed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) script to fit the coefficients of a polynomial model for $r(M_c)$. The MCMC uses the smoothing prior as defined in section \ref{subsec:likelihood}. We performed a least square fit first in order to obtain the initial guess for the coefficients of the model.
